# Backup Website Hardware Requirements for 1 Million Users on AWS

## Overview

To ensure seamless operation and high availability of our backup website in case of a failure of the main website, we need to estimate the hardware requirements based on 1 million active users. The following document provides a detailed estimation for each critical component, utilizing AWS services such as EC2 instances, RDS for databases, and other relevant AWS offerings.

## AWS Services and Configurations

### 1. Frontend Servers (Web Servers)

**Assumptions**:
- Peak concurrent users: 5% of total active users (50,000 users)
- Each web server can handle 2,000 concurrent connections

**Calculation**:
- Number of web servers needed = Peak concurrent users / Connections per server
- = 50,000 / 2,000
- = 25 servers

**Configuration**:
- **AWS Service**: EC2
- **Instance Type**: m5.large (2 vCPUs, 8GB RAM)
- **Quantity**: 25

### 2. Application Servers

**Assumptions**:
- Each application server can handle 1,000 RPS (requests per second)
- Average of 5 requests per second per active user during peak hours (50,000 users * 5 RPS = 250,000 RPS)

**Calculation**:
- Number of application servers needed = Total RPS / RPS per server
- = 250,000 / 1,000
- = 250 servers

**Configuration**:
- **AWS Service**: EC2
- **Instance Type**: m5.2xlarge (8 vCPUs, 32GB RAM)
- **Quantity**: 250

### 3. Database Servers

**Assumptions**:
- High volume of transactions requires robust and scalable database setup
- Utilize sharding and replication for performance and redundancy
- Assume 1 primary server for write operations and 2 replicas for read operations

**Calculation**:
- Number of shards based on user data distribution: Assume 1 shard per 200,000 users
- Total shards = 1,000,000 / 200,000
- = 5 shards
- Each shard has 1 primary and 2 replica servers = 5 * 3
- = 15 servers

**Configuration**:
- **AWS Service**: RDS for MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Instance Type**: db.m5.4xlarge (16 vCPUs, 64GB RAM, 1TB SSD storage)
- **Quantity**: 15 (5 primary, 10 replicas)

### 4. Messaging Queue Servers

**Assumptions**:
- Each server can handle 50,000 messages per second
- Peak messaging load: 250,000 RPS

**Calculation**:
- Number of messaging queue servers needed = Peak RPS / Messages per server
- = 250,000 / 50,000
- = 5 servers

**Configuration**:
- **AWS Service**: EC2 with Kafka or Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Kafka)
- **Instance Type**: m5.large (2 vCPUs, 8GB RAM)
- **Quantity**: 5

### 5. Load Balancers

**Assumptions**:
- Load balancers should handle twice the peak concurrent connections for redundancy

**Calculation**:
- Number of load balancers needed = (Peak concurrent users / Connections per load balancer) * 2
- Assuming each load balancer can handle 50,000 connections
- = (50,000 / 50,000) * 2
- = 2 load balancers

**Configuration**:
- **AWS Service**: Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
- **Quantity**: 2

### 6. Monitoring and Alerting System

**Assumptions**:
- Monitoring infrastructure should be able to collect metrics from all servers and handle alerting

**Calculation**:
- Based on 250 application servers, 25 web servers, 15 database servers, and 5 messaging queue servers (total 295 servers)
- Assume 1 monitoring server per 100 monitored servers

**Configuration**:
- **AWS Service**: CloudWatch
- **Instance Type**: m5.large (2 vCPUs, 8GB RAM)
- **Quantity**: 3 (rounding up)

### 7. Backup Infrastructure

**Assumptions**:
- Ensure data redundancy and backup for databases and critical services

**Calculation**:
- Based on the number of database servers (15), assume 1 backup server for every 5 database servers

**Configuration**:
- **AWS Service**: S3 for backups, EC2 for backup servers
- **Instance Type**: m5.large (2 vCPUs, 8GB RAM)
- **Quantity**: 3 (rounding up)

## Additional Considerations

- **Network Bandwidth**: Ensure sufficient bandwidth to handle peak traffic loads, especially for real-time data synchronization.
- **Redundancy and Failover**: Implement redundant network paths and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to scale horizontally, allowing the addition of more servers as needed.

These estimates provide a starting point for planning and budgeting the backup website infrastructure to handle 1 million active users using AWS services. Adjustments may be necessary based on detailed performance testing and specific business requirements.
