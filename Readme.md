The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive specification for the microservices architecture of the backup website for order square-off. It outlines the functionality, interfaces, and interactions of each microservice to ensure a clear understanding of the system's requirements and design.

#### 1.2 Scope

This document covers the detailed requirements and design specifications for the following microservices:
- Authentication Service
- User Service
- Trade Service
- Position Service
- Order Service
- Exchange Adapter
- Notification Service
- Session Service
- Data Synchronization Service
- Monitoring Service

These microservices collectively enable the backup website to provide seamless order square-off functionalities during main website failures, ensuring business continuity.

### 2. Microservices Overview

- **Example Flow**:
  1. Receives order execution requests from the frontend.
  2. Validates order parameters and availability of funds.
  3. Sends order details to the Exchange Adapter for execution.

#### 2.6 Exchange Adapter

- **Description**: Integrates with the exchange API for order processing.
- **Functionality**: 
  - Communicate with the exchange API for real-time order placement.
  - Receive execution confirmations and status updates.
- **Interfaces**: 
  - TCP/IP for communication with the exchange API.
  - gRPC for communication with Order Service.
- **Example Flow**:
  1. Receives order details from the Order Service.
  2. Sends order requests to the exchange API via TCP/IP.
  3. Receives execution responses and updates order status.

#### 2.7 Notification Service

- **Description**: Sends notifications to users and administrators.
- **Functionality**: 
  - Notify users of order status updates (filled, canceled).
  - Alert administrators of system events (failovers, maintenance).
- **Interfaces**: 
  - HTTP/HTTPS for communication with User Interface, Monitoring Service.
- **Example Flow**:
  1. Receives notification triggers from various microservices.
  2. Formats and sends notifications via email, SMS, or in-app messages.

#### 2.8 Session Service

- **Description**: Manages user sessions and authentication tokens.
- **Functionality**: 
  - Generate and validate session tokens.
  - Maintain session state and expiration.
- **Interfaces**: 
  - gRPC for communication with Authentication Service, User Interface.
- **Example Flow**:
  1. Generates a session token upon successful login.
  2. Validates session tokens for subsequent user requests.
  3. Manages session state and expiration to ensure security.

#### 2.9 Data Synchronization Service

- **Description**: Ensures real-time synchronization of trade and order data.
- **Functionality**:
