### Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations for Hardware Requirements

#### Assumptions:
- **Peak users:** 5.5 lakhs (550,000)
- **1% of peak users during peak duration (half hour):** 0.01 * 550,000 = 5,500 users
- **Peak duration:** Half hour (30 minutes)
- **Average order requests per user:** 2 orders per minute (considering active trading scenario)

#### Components and Their Requirements:

1. **Frontend (Web Servers):**
   - Each web server can handle approximately 500 concurrent users.
   - **Total required web servers:** 
     \[
     \frac{5,500 \text{ users}}{500 \text{ users/server}} = 11 \text{ servers}
     \]

2. **Load Balancer:**
   - To distribute traffic among web servers efficiently.
   - Assume we need 2 load balancers for redundancy.

3. **Application Servers:**
   - Each application server can handle approximately 250 concurrent sessions.
   - **Total required application servers:** 
     \[
     \frac{5,500 \text{ sessions}}{250 \text{ sessions/server}} = 22 \text{ servers}
     \]

4. **Database Servers:**
   - Assume the primary database can handle up to 10,000 read/write operations per second.
   - Considering high availability, we would need at least 2 database servers (Primary and Standby).
   - For peak operations:
     \[
     5,500 \text{ users} \times 2 \text{ orders/min} \times 30 \text{ mins} = 330,000 \text{ transactions}
     \]
   - Transactions per second (TPS):
     \[
     \frac{330,000 \text{ transactions}}{30 \text{ mins} \times 60 \text{ seconds}} = 183 \text{ TPS}
     \]
   - A single database server with 10,000 TPS capability is more than sufficient.

5. **Messaging Queue:**
   - Assume using RabbitMQ/Kafka where each node can handle 50,000 messages per second.
   - For redundancy and load balancing, assume 3 nodes (1 primary and 2 replicas).

6. **Monitoring System:**
   - Assume lightweight monitoring for each component.
   - 1-2 servers dedicated to monitoring tools like Prometheus/Grafana.

#### Summary:

- **Frontend Web Servers:** 11 servers
- **Load Balancers:** 2 units
- **Application Servers:** 22 servers
- **Database Servers:** 2 servers (1 primary, 1 standby)
- **Messaging Queue Nodes:** 3 nodes
- **Monitoring Servers:** 2 servers

#### Estimation of Hardware Specifications:
- **Web Servers:**
  - CPU: 4 cores
  - RAM: 16 GB
  - Storage: 100 GB SSD

- **Application Servers:**
  - CPU: 8 cores
  - RAM: 32 GB
  - Storage: 200 GB SSD

- **Database Servers:**
  - CPU: 16 cores
  - RAM: 64 GB
  - Storage: 1 TB SSD (RAID 10 configuration)

- **Messaging Queue Nodes:**
  - CPU: 8 cores
  - RAM: 32 GB
  - Storage: 500 GB SSD

- **Monitoring Servers:**
  - CPU: 4 cores
  - RAM: 16 GB
  - Storage: 500 GB SSD

### Total Hardware Requirement Summary:

| Component                | Quantity | CPU (Total Cores) | RAM (Total GB) | Storage (Total GB) |
|--------------------------|----------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Web Servers              | 11       | 44                | 176            | 1100               |
| Load Balancers           | 2        | 8                 | 32             | 200                |
| Application Servers      | 22       | 176               | 704            | 4400               |
| Database Servers         | 2        | 32                | 128            | 2000               |
| Messaging Queue Nodes    | 3        | 24                | 96             | 1500               |

### Conclusion:
This back-of-the-envelope calculation provides an initial estimate of the hardware requirements needed to support the backup website for ICICI Securities' trading platform during failover scenarios. This plan includes redundancy and scalability considerations to ensure continuous operation without performance degradation. Further refinement of these estimates would involve detailed performance testing and profiling based on actual system behavior under load.
